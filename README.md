This repository contains source code for the AirBnB clone website.  
The goal of the project is to deploy a simple copy of the AirBnB website.

The complete web application developed in this project is composed by:

* A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)
* A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
* A database or files that store data (data = objects)
* An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)
